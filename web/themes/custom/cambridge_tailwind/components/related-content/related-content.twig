/**
 * The Related links component is the replacement for the signposting component on the basic page. Signposting was a broad term and become confusing with the amount of options. Itâ€™s been stripped back to a simple list of links without the option to add images and descriptions at this stage.
 *
 * Title - a required string that labels the group of links by their purpose
 * Links - A collection of links that will be displayed in order. Each link has a required title and a required URL. Each link can either be link to an internal page (searchable by autocomplete) or a external pasted URL. The styling treatment will differ based on this.
